	image by extracting the embedded watermarks. This work presents a
	reversible image watermarking approach that works on quantized DCT
	coefficients, implying that the original quantized image can be recovered
	perfectly after watermark extraction. The concept of zero replacement
	reversible watermarking is presented. Two parameters adjustment rules,
	ZRE and ZRX, are first proposed to embed and extract one bit to DCT
	coefficients, respectively. Additionally, the CA rule is presented
	to prevent confusion during embedding and extraction. Watermark embedding
	and extracting algorithms based on these three rules are then proposed.
	Experimental results indicate that the quality of watermarked image
	is very good, and that the proposed approach can also identify maliciously
	attacked regions efficiently. The proposed approach is also compared
	with other watermarking methods, demonstrating that the proposed
	approach works well. },

  abstract = {Current difference-expansion (DE) embedding techniques perform one
	layer embedding in a difference image. They do not turn to the next
	difference image for another layer embedding unless the current difference
	image has no expandable differences left. The obvious disadvantage
	of these techniques is that image quality may have been severely
	degraded even before the later layer embedding begins because the
	previous layer embedding has used up all expandable differences,
	including those with large magnitude. Based on integer Haar wavelet
	transform, we propose a new DE embedding algorithm, which utilizes
	the horizontal as well as vertical difference images for data hiding.
	We introduce a dynamical expandable difference search and selection
	mechanism. This mechanism gives even chances to small differences
	in two difference images and effectively avoids the situation that
	the largest differences in the first difference image are used up
	while there is almost no chance to embed in small differences of
	the second difference image. We also present an improved histogram-based
	difference selection and shifting scheme, which refines our algorithm
	and makes it resilient to different types of images. Compared with
	current algorithms, the proposed algorithm often has better embedding
	capacity versus image quality performance. The advantage of our algorithm
	is more obvious near the embedding rate of 0.5 bpp. },

  abstract = {This paper proposes a lossless data hiding scheme with high embedding
	capacity, which can recover the original image without any distortion
	after the hidden data have been extracted. In this scheme, difference
	value of the adjacent pixels is calculated first. After adjusting
	the difference slightly, we can increase (decrease) it by I or maintain
	it intact to embed information into the cover image. Experimental
	results show that the average embedding capacity can be up to 0.91bpp
	(bit per pixel) while the PSNR stays larger than 30dB. Compared with
	some existing known lossless data hiding schemes, the proposed method
	provides higher embedding capacity and lower image degradation. Moreover,
	the presented algorithm is quite simple and the execution time is
	rather short. },

	reversible, the decoder not only can extract hidden data from the
	embedded image but also can completely recover the original image
	without distortion. Two reversible data hiding methods based on histogram
	modification are proposed in this paper. The proposed methods differ
	from other histogram modification based schemes. The peak point in
	the histogram keeps unchanged for retrieving hidden data without
	additional side information. Thus, secret data will be embedded in
	the peak's neighbouring pixels. Additionally, the original image
	is divided into blocks to increase embedding capacity. Experimental
	results show that the authors' methods can achieve a high image quality
	above 48 dB and have high embedding capacity. },

  abstract = {A novel reversible binary image data hiding scheme using run-length
	(RL) histogram modification is presented in this paper. The binary
	image is scanned from left to right and from top to bottom to form
	a sequence of alternative black RL and white RL. Combining one black
	RL and its immediate next white RL, we form one RL couple, thus generating
	a sequence of RL couples. The length of each couple is fixed during
	data embedding in order not to fail the reversibility. Two procedures
	are adopted to achieve reversibility: 1) only involve those RL couples
	in data embedding in which the length of couple is not shorter than
	threshold T1; 2) increase white RL of isolated white pixels from
	one to two. Another parameter T indicates where to embed data in
	black RL histogram. Adjusting T1 and T may result in optimum performance
	of pure embedding rate versus visual quality of marked image. The
	proposed scheme works for text, graphics, and their mixture, both
	halftone and non-halftone binary images. Experimental works have
	shown its superior performs over the prior-arts. },

  abstract = {This paper proposes a reversible data hiding method for digital audio
	using prediction error expansion technique. Firstly, the prediction
	error of the original audio is obtained by applying an integer coefficient
	predictor. Secondly, a location map is set up to record the expandability
	of all audio samples, and then it is compressed by lossless compression
	coding and taken as a part of secret information. Finally, the reconstructed
	secret information is embedded into the audio using prediction error
	expansion technique. After extracting the embedded information, the
	original audio can be perfectly restored. Experimental results show
	that the proposed algorithm can achieve high embedding capacity while
	keeping good quality of the stego-audio. },
