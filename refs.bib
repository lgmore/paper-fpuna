However, \{HE\} and most other contrast enhancement methods may produce un-natural looking images and the images obtained by these methods are not desirable in applications such as consumer electronic products where brightness preservation is necessary to avoid annoying artifacts. To solve such problems, we proposed an efficient contrast enhancement method based on genetic algorithm in this paper. The proposed method uses a simple and novel chromosome representation together with corresponding operators. Experimental results showed that this method makes natural looking images especially when the dynamic range of input image is high. Also, it has been shown by simulation results that the proposed genetic method had better results than related ones in terms of contrast and detail enhancement and the resulted images were suitable for consumer electronic products.

abstract = "Abstract Histogram Equalization (HE) is a simple and effective technique for enhancing the contrast of the input image. However, it fails to preserve the brightness while enhancing the contrast due to the abrupt mean shift during the process of equalization. Many \{HE\} based methods have been developed to overcome the problem of mean shift. But, they suffered from over-enhancement. In this paper, a multi-objective \{HE\} model has been proposed in order to enhance the contrast as well as to preserve the brightness. The central idea of this technique is to first segment the histogram of the input image into two using Otsu's threshold. A set of optimized weighing constraints are formulated and applied on both the sub-images. Then, the sub-images are equalized independently and their union produces the contrast enhanced, brightness preserved output image. Here, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed to find the optimal constraints. This technique is proved to have an edge over the other contemporary methods in terms of entropy and contrast improvement index. "
